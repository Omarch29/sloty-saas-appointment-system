## Service Configuration

### üìã Service Parameters

Services can collect additional information through dynamic parameters:

**Parameter Types**:
- **Text**: Name, notes, descriptions
- **Number**: Age, weight, quantity
- **Date/Time**: Preferred times, birth date
- **Select**: Dropdown choices
- **Boolean**: Yes/no questions
- **File**: Upload documents, images

**Example Medical Consultation**:
```json
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "reason",
      "label": "Reason for visit",
      "type": "TEXTAREA",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "symptoms",
      "label": "Current symptoms",
      "type": "MULTISELECT", 
      "options": ["Pain", "Fatigue", "Nausea", "Other"]
    },
    {
      "name": "medications",
      "label": "Current medications",
      "type": "TEXT"
    },
    {
      "name": "insurance",
      "label": "Insurance provider",
      "type": "SELECT",
      "options": ["Blue Cross", "Aetna", "Cigna", "Self-pay"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling Rules

Services have flexible scheduling configuration:

- **Duration**: How long the appointment takes
- **Buffer Time**: Padding between appointments  
- **Advance Booking**: How far in advance bookings allowed
- **Approval Required**: Manual approval vs auto-confirmation
- **Location Restrictions**: Which locations offer this service
- **Provider Restrictions**: Which providers can deliver this service

## Provider Availability

### üìÖ Availability Patterns

Providers have sophisticated availability management:

**Regular Schedule**:
```json
{
  "monday": { "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" },
  "tuesday": { "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" },
  "wednesday": { "start": "10:00", "end": "14:00" },
  "thursday": { "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" },
  "friday": { "start": "09:00", "end": "15:00" },
  "saturday": "closed",
  "sunday": "closed"
}
```

**Schedule Overrides**:
- Vacation time blocking

- Meeting blocks

**Availability Validation**:
- Prevents double-booking
- Respects buffer times
- Considers travel time between locations

## Appointment Lifecycle

### üìä Status Management

Appointments progress through various states:

```mermaid

    [*] --> SCHEDULED: Booking confirmed
    SCHEDULED --> CONFIRMED: Customer confirms
    SCHEDULED --> CANCELLED: Cancelled before confirmation
    CONFIRMED --> CHECKED_IN: Customer arrives
    CONFIRMED --> CANCELLED: Cancelled after confirmation
    CONFIRMED --> NO_SHOW: Customer doesn't arrive
    CHECKED_IN --> IN_PROGRESS: Appointment starts
    IN_PROGRESS --> COMPLETED: Service finished
    COMPLETED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*] 
    NO_SHOW --> [*]
```

**Status Definitions**:
- **SCHEDULED**: Initially booked, awaiting confirmation
- **CONFIRMED**: Customer has confirmed attendance

- **Customization**: Each tenant can customize their experience
- **Security**: Row-level security prevents data leaks

### üîó Relationships

Key relationships in the system:

```mermaid

    TENANT ||--o{ SERVICE : offers
